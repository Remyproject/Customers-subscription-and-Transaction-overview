Your fastest-growing tier has also become your biggest risk for losing customers.

In the last 18 months, churn has lowered your lifetime value by 20%. I reviewed three years of subscription data from Nordic markets and found insights that could help you rethink your growth strategy. Here’s what I discovered.

The MAX tier leads in revenue, with a total of $ 438,000, representing an 81% year-over-year growth. It has 4,378 customers and continues to grow steadily.

Most companies would see these results as a reason to celebrate and push harder to get new customers.

However, it's essential to examine customer retention more closely.

The churn rate has reached 9.4%, which is a 95.6% increase from last year. This has caused $49.9K in lost revenue.

You are still adding new customers faster than you lose them, but that lead is shrinking quickly.

The PRO tier is experiencing growth, with $244,000 in revenue (up 65.8% year-over-year) and a customer count of 5,499, the highest to date. There are strong mid-year revenue peaks, suggesting a hidden success pattern. If you can identify and repeat this pattern in other periods, you could turn these seasonal wins into steady gains all year.

However, churn has increased by 42.7% since last year, resulting in $35.9K in lost revenue.

This isn’t just about losing numbers. It means high-value customers are leaving.

The BASIC tier has the most customers, at 6,034, but generates only $48.9K in revenue, which is the lowest among all tiers. Revenue is down 7.5% from last year.

The churn rate for BASIC is 15.8%, up 83.9% from last year, resulting in $24.1K in lost revenue.

You have the most customers in this tier, but they generate the least revenue and are leaving at a faster rate than before.

Here’s the pattern that could change everything.

All three tiers have the same problem: churn is rising everywhere.

BASIC churn is up 83.9%, PRO churn is up 42.7%, and MAX churn is up 95.6%.

When churn is rising in every tier, it’s not just a product issue. It’s a sign from the market. What are customers getting from competitors that we’re missing? This could indicate unmet needs that extend beyond product tweaks. Something changed between 2020 and 2022 that’s affecting retention across the board.

Maybe competitors have improved. Maybe customer expectations have shifted. Maybe your onboarding process needs work.

However, regardless of the cause, increasing spending on Google Ads and Facebook, your primary acquisition channels, won’t solve the problem.

What the acquisition data reveals

You spend about the same amount to acquire customers in each tier:

* Google Ads brings in between 1,400 and 1,900 customers per tier.
* Facebook brings in between 1,200 and 1,900 customers per tier.

You use the same channels and get similar customer numbers, but the results are very different.

BASIC has 6,034 customers and brings in $48.9K in revenue. MAX has 4,378 customers and generates $ 438,000.

That’s a ninefold difference in revenue per customer.

Your acquisition strategy treats all tiers equally, rather than tailoring your approach to each one.

That’s why BASIC is filled with low-value customers, while MAX struggles to keep its high-value ones.

The key business decision hidden in this dashboard

Stop treating growth and retention as separate issues.

MAX is growing at 81%, but churn is up 95.6%. If this continues, growth could stall in the next 12 to 18 months.

PRO has the most customers, but with a 14% churn rate, you’re constantly trying to refill a leaky bucket.

BASIC has the most customers, but the worst unit economics. Each new customer here costs more to support than they generate in revenue.

Here’s what I would do if I were running this business.

First, pause new BASIC customer acquisition until you fix the unit economics or adjust pricing. High volume without profit only adds extra cost.

Focus on keeping MAX customers before churn slows your growth. Interview customers to find out why premium users are leaving. Ask questions like, "Which first-30-day moments are failing our premium users?" Use these answers to guide your interviews and spot possible onboarding issues. Improving early experiences can significantly impact MAX customer retention.

Next, look at PRO’s mid-year revenue peaks and late-year declines. This pattern may indicate seasonal trends or campaign timing issues that can be addressed to improve performance.

Additionally, consider running acquisition campaigns tailored to each tier. Don’t send the same Google Ads and Facebook traffic to all three tiers and expect the same results.



This is what strong analytics should look like.

It’s not just about showing what happened.

It’s about revealing patterns that help predict what’s coming next.

I built this dashboard in Power BI, with automated daily updates from subscription databases, transaction logs, and marketing attribution data.

Now executives can see churn trends alongside growth metrics and make decisions before small problems become costly.

That’s the difference between reporting what happened and predicting what’s next.
